						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"The name 'rose' is derived from the Latin word rosa. During the
						height of Rome, roses were grown extensively in the Middle East and
						used as medicine, perfumes, and at celebrations as confetti. In
						England, roses as emblems suited the mood of a romantic Victorian
						age. The famous 15th century 'War of the Roses' was titled due to
						its wartime symbolism. White represented York, and red represented
						Lancaster; both factions were competing for the control of the
						country. The emblematic roses became famous after William Shakespeare
						and other authors wrote about the struggle."
