						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"Delphinium gets its name from the Greek word 'delphis,' which means
						dolphin. This refers to the shape of its closed flower buds, which
						resembles the nose of a dolphin. Delphiniums are also known as larkspurs, which is
						an annual species of delphinium. According to Greek mythology the
						delphinium originated from the blood of the Greek god Aias (also known
						as Ajax), a Trojan war hero who was killed during combat. As the flowers
						blossomed from his blood, its petals became inscribed with the letters
						'Ai' which means alas in Greek."
