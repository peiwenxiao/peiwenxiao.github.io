						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"Carnations scientific name is Dianthus caryophyllus.
						Some believe the name Dianthus originated from the myth of Diana.
						Diana, goddess of the hunt, was returning from an unsuccessful
						hunting trip. She stumbled upon a shepherd playing a flute and
						blamed his music for spoiling her hunting. In a fit of rage she
						attacked him and plucked out his eyes. Once she cooled down, she
						regretted her actions. Where the eyes fell, red carnations grew as
						signs of innocent blood."
