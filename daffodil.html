						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"The Latin name for daffodil is Narcissus. It is believed to be named
						after the son of the river god from Greek mythology. Narcissus was
						celebrated for his beauty, but he was arrogant. The goddess Nemesis
						noticed this and lured him to a pool where he fell in love with his
						own reflection. Some sources say while he was staring at his reflection
						nymphs transformed him into a narcissus flower to get revenge for how
						he treated them. Others think he drowned trying to capture his reflection,
						and the flowers growing along the riverbed were named after him. Some even
						liken the nodding heads of daffodil flowers to Narcissus bending down and
						gazing at his reflection."
