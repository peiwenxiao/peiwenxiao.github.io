						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"The aster is a unique daisy-like wildflower that’s known for its
						star-shaped flower head. With a rich history in Greek mythology,
						it’s said that the aster was created by the tears of the Greek goddess,
						Astraea. One day, she was so upset by how few stars there were in the
						dark sky, that she began to cry. As she wept, her tears fell to the
						ground and turned into star-shaped aster flowers. Thus, the flower was
						named after her, with aster meaning star. Another interpretation is
						that asters were created when Virgo scattered stardust over the Earth.
						Where the stardust settled, aster flowers bloomed."
