						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"The ancient Greek myth of Apollo and Clytie is one explanation of why
						sunflowers turn towards the sun. In this story Clytie, a nymph, adored
						Apollo. At first, he loved her back, but soon he fell in love with Leucothoe.
						Because of her jealousy, Clytie told Leucothoeâ€™s father of the relationship
						and he punished her by burying her alive. In anger, Apollo turned her
						into a flower, but even in flower form she still loved him and would
						spend her days watching him as he moved the sun across the sky in his
						chariot, just like sunflowers move to face the sun."
