						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"The first chrysanthemums were cultivated in China centuries ago.
						It has appeared in ancient Chinese writings as early as 15th century
						BC and was used as an herbal remedy. Its boiled roots were believed
						to provide headache relief, and the sprouts and petals were eaten in
						salads. From China, the chrysanthemum
						made its way over to Japan by Buddhist monks in AD 400. Soon after its
						introduction, the Japanese were so enamored by this beautiful flower
						that it was soon adopted as the emperorâ€™s crest and official seal."
