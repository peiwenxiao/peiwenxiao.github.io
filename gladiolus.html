						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"Gladioli have a unique long and pointed shape. Because of their shape,
						they are named after the Latin word “gladius”, meaning sword. In Rome,
						gladioli were associated with gladiators. Some say that gladiators wore
						gladiolus corms around their necks during battles to help them win and
						protect them from death. Because of their association with gladiators,
						the gladiolus flower meaning is strength, integrity and infatuation.
						By giving a gladiolus to someone, the giver sends the message
						'you pierce my heart' to the receiver, because of the flower’s pointed
						shape."
