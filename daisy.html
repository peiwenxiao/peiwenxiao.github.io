						STORY & ORIGINS<br>
						"Vertumnus, god of seasons and gardens, became enamored with Belides,
						a nymph. He continuously pursued her, and in order to escape his
						affections she turned herself into a daisy. Daisy’s scientific name
						Bellis, stems from this story.Daisy’s are composite flowers, meaning
						that they actually consist of two flowers combined into one. The inner
						section is called a disc floret, and the outer petal section is called
						a ray floret. Because daisies are composed of two flowers that blend
						together so well, they also symbolize true love."
